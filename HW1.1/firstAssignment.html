    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page!</h1>


    <p>This page illustrates how you can write proper HTML using only a text editor,<br>
    such as Windows Notepad. You can also download a free text editor, such as <br>
    Crimson Editor, which is better than Notepad.</p>

    <p>There is a small graphic after the period at the end of thissentence.
      <img src="mickey.jpeg" width="50" height= "50"> The <br>
    graphic is in a file. The file is inside a folder named "images".</p>

    <p>Link: <a href="https://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></p>
    <p>Note the way the BR tag works in the two lines above.</p>
